## Application Configuration

Before starting the application, configure the settings file:

- **Using the Template:**  
  The project includes `appsettings.sample.json` with sample (masked) values.

- **Creating the Configuration File:**  
  Copy or rename `appsettings.sample.json` to `appsettings.json` (usually in `src/main/resources/`).

- **Editing:**  
  Open `appsettings.json` and fill in the required parameters:
  - Database connection details (host, port, schema, user, password).
  - Other necessary settings (e.g., token configuration).
